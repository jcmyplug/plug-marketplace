/* ─── VITE CONFIG ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Replaces Create React App, which the React team deprecated in February 2025
   and which has had no release since react-scripts 5.0.1. See
   DEPENDENCY-AUDIT.md for why that mattered more than the advisory noise.

   Two settings below are deliberately NOT the Vite defaults, to keep the blast
   radius of this migration small:

     outDir: "build"     Vite defaults to "dist". Vercel and vercel.json are
                         already pointed at "build", so keeping the name means
                         the deploy config does not have to change in lockstep.

     assetsDir: "static" Vite defaults to "assets". vercel.json caches
                         /static/(.*) as immutable for a year, and the CSP is
                         written against it. Renaming the folder would silently
                         drop that cache header — the kind of regression that
                         does not fail a build and does not show up until the
                         bill or the Lighthouse score moves.

             React and react-dom go in their own chunk.

             BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT DO. It does not make the
             first visit smaller — a new visitor still downloads the same bytes,
             now in two files instead of one. What it changes is the SECOND
             visit, and every visit after a deploy.

             Assets here are content-hashed and cached immutably for a year by
             vercel.json. One chunk means one hash: change a line of app code and
             the hash changes, so a returning visitor re-downloads React too,
             even though React did not change. React and react-dom are roughly
             140KB of the bundle and they change a few times a year, while app
             code changes several times a day. Separating them means a deploy
             re-downloads only the part that actually moved.

             Everything else stays in the main chunk on purpose. There are only
             three direct dependencies (see DEPENDENCY-AUDIT.md), so there is no
             third "vendor" bundle worth carving out, and inventing one would
             add a request for no benefit.

             Matching by path rather than the shorter `{ react: ["react",
             "react-dom"] }` form on purpose. That form names package ENTRY
             points, which misses react-dom/client and react/jsx-runtime — both
             of which this app uses — and, more importantly, misses `scheduler`,
             which react-dom depends on. Leaving scheduler in the app chunk is
             the known way to get a circular import between the two chunks and a
             blank page that the build reports as successful. */
